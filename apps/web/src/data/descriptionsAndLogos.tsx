      "BE YOUR OWN FIRE\n\nIn the heart of the ancient world, where stories were etched on cavern walls and whispered across campfires, the triangle emerged as an emblem of energy and ardor. It wasn't merely a shape; it was an echo of the fierce and untamed spirit of fire itself. The triangle, with its three sharp corners, was seen as a conduit for the earth's raw passion and the cosmos' brightest flames.\n\nBorn from this legendary lore is Azzar—a brand that rekindles the spirit of fire in a modern, edgy, and playful twist. Azzar isn't just about products; it's about rebellion against the ordinary. It's about challenging norms and rewriting the playbook of design.\n\n\nImagine a world where clocks aren't bound by their circular confines, where the triangular minute hand of Azzar tracks time in its own audacious way.

      "VISION\n\nIn the midst of an island, found in the land of desert, lies a teeny tiny white workshop, where a young girl at the age of 23 decided to make a 40-piece beachwear collection out of her grandma’s year-long collected fabrics. She knew little about garments and production at the time, but her persistence and faith kept her going. Prints were infused; colors were harmonized; stitches were made, and the dream finally came true.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, FUFA was born.\n\nDesigning for a community that shares a lust for travel, beautiful music, art, and freedom! FUFA's pieces are made to make every girl feel special, liberated, and beautiful.\n\nThey're wanderers, and they’ll be with you wherever you go…\n\nWhether you’re tenting out in the deserts of Fayoum, dancing barefoot to the tunes of a music festival, or simply soaking up the serenity of Castle Zaman. FUFA believes clothes embody memories, and they’d like to create them for you. In every shape and form.\n\nIn all the colors your heart desires. Explore and uncover; sing and dance; paint and laugh… Enjoy every minute life has to offer!\n\nABOUT THE DESIGNER\n\nFarah El Ashiry ~ aka FUFA\n\nFufa's creative exploration started early on at the age of 10, when she reused old clothes to make new stylish pieces to wear.\n\nWhen she got older, she sought her dream and studied Marketing at the American University in Cairo (AUC), taking all her classes in the morning just so she could rush to the Italian Fashion Academy in the afternoon, where she obtained a diploma in Fashion Design and Pattern Making.\n\nBut her dual studies didn't keep her from starting an oriental Egyptian brand during her first year at AUC. She named it 'BENT AL-BALAD' (meaning a local girl) and made oriental cushions and Bedouin-inspired skirts, selling them in markets.\n\nShe then tapped into glamorous evening wear by customizing dresses, and later on (still in her college years) she decided to start her own fancy wear line 'PetiteBourgeoisie.' But with one month before the launch, her grandmother inspired her to do the opposite, and revealed to her what can only be described as a cupboard of mesmerizing prints.\n\nFufa's loving grandparents were a big inspiration during her childhood and still today. It was with her grandmother's collection of Asian fabrics that she created her first beachwear collection. And it is her grandfather's love for Egypt that motivated the destination-inspired collections. He would always tell her that \"Egypt is filled with culture and crafts, that are yet to be discovered or might have been already discovered and died out.\"\n\nWith that, Fufa began her journey…\n\nMuch Love,\n\nFUFA, FOUNDER & DESIGNER\n\n“Fufa's vision is to show Egypt’s diverse culture, to aid the people living in it, and give our customers a piece that is made with value and passion, produced from sustainable resources and made for the purpose of change.”",

Our streetwear is designed for those who appreciate the fine balance between self-expression and subtlety. We make a statement. \n\nWhat 'Verve' Means to Us\n\n'Verve' is the new State of Mind. It's that electrifying surge of energy that accompanies the moments of youthful exuberance. It's the passion that drives us to be a dynamic force in our community. We've made it our mission to embody 'Verve' in everything we do, from our designs to our community engagement.\n\nOur Commitment\n\nWe're not just here to provide you with streetwear; we're here to inspire you. Our commitment is to empower this generation to express themselves authentically and without inhibition. We're more than a clothing brand; we're a platform for creative souls to shine.\n\nWelcome to JUVENILE Fam. Make a statement, and make it minimal.",
